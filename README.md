# Restaurant Data Analysis
Analysed restaurant data of 1000 records for predicting amount of tip the waiter will earn based on parameters such as day, time, bill payer gender. 
Predicted on which time of a particular day the restaurant will be most occupied. Visualized data that enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. 


Technologies : Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Analysed restaurant data of 1000 records for predicting amount of tip the waiter will earn based on parameters such as day, time, bill payer gender. Predicted on which time of a particular day the restaurant will be most occupied. Visualized data that enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. 

System Flow:- 
•	Data retrieval using panda library 
•	Transform and clean the data using numpy & panda library 
•	Split the data into test and training set so we can test our model before we use it 
•	Build Machine Learning model, in this project: linear regression model 
•	Training model using training set 
•	Predicting the dependent parameter 

Technical wrap-up: 
• Implementation in Python language 
• Used Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
